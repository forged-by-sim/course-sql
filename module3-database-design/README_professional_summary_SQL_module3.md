# 🧱 Module 3: Database Design

**Course:** Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)  
**Platform:** Coursera – University of Michigan  
**Instructor:** Dr. Charles Severance  
**Module Folder:** `module3-database-design`

⸻

## 🧠 Learning Focus

This module focused on designing structured databases using relational principles. It introduced:

- **Primary keys**: Unique identifiers for each record  
- **Foreign keys**: Links between tables to enforce relationships  
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**: Visual tools for planning schema connections  
- **Normalization**: Designing tables to minimize redundancy and optimize data integrity

⸻

## 🗂️ Core Concepts

- Designing for **1:1**, **1:N**, and **M:N** relationships
- Using foreign keys to enforce referential integrity
- Planning schemas before writing SQL code
- Modeling real-world data interactions with database diagrams

## 📝 Reflections

Though no coding was required in this module, the design concepts laid the foundation for what came next — implementing a many-to-many schema and joining data in Module 4.

I found the ERD examples helpful for visualizing how complex systems (like courses, students, or inventory) could be broken into multiple connected tables. This mindset will be useful in simulation backend design, where objects and interactions often mirror real-world relational logic.
