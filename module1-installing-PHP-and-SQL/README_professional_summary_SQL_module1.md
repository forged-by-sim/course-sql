# 🧰 Module 1: Installing PHP and SQL

**Course:** Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)  
**Platform:** Coursera – University of Michigan  
**Instructor:** Dr. Charles Severance  
**Module Folder:** `module1-installing-PHP-and-SQL`

⸻

## 🖥️ Learning Focus

This module focused on preparing the environment needed to begin working with SQL in both browser-based and local setups. It included guidance for:

- Installing a code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Setting up database engines (MAMP, XAMPP, or LAMP)
- Installing and configuring SQLite or MySQL
- Running PHP and SQL code locally
- Exploring the terminal/command line for database interactions

⸻

## 🔧 Tools Explored

- **SQLite** – Lightweight, file-based database engine used for most exercises
- **MySQL** – Installed via MAMP/XAMPP to simulate server-based SQL environments
- **DB Browser for SQLite** – GUI-based database browser for running queries locally
- **VS Code** – Used for editing `.sql` and `.txt` scripts

## 📎 Reflections

Even though there was no formal graded assignment, this module was critical in preparing my system for SQL experimentation. I chose to install:

- **SQLite** as my primary engine
- **VS Code** as my editor
- **DB Browser for SQLite** to run queries outside the command line

I skipped installing XAMPP/MAMP for MySQL initially, but later revisited this for compatibility testing during Module 2.
