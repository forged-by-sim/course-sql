## 🎯 Course Objective

This course introduced the foundational concepts and hands-on practice of Structured Query Language (SQL), including:

- Creating and populating relational databases
- Writing SQL queries to extract, sort, and filter data
- Performing JOIN operations across multiple tables
- Exporting query results into JSON-compatible formats
- Structuring many-to-many relationships using foreign keys

## 🧩 Course Modules Overview

### 📦 Module 1: Installing PHP and SQL *(Light Summary)*  
Focused on setting up the technical environment using MAMP/XAMPP or LAMP, and selecting a code editor.  
Also included guidance on installing SQLite and preparing for command-line usage.  
No required assignments, but essential for technical readiness.

### 📊 Module 2: Introduction to Structured Query Language *(Professional Summary)*  
Hands-on project with an `Ages` table using both MySQL and SQLite formats.  
Covered:
- Table creation
- INSERT operations
- SELECT and ORDER BY clauses
- Debugging type mismatches across engines  
📁 *Folder: `module2-introduction-to-structured-query-language`*

### 🧱 Module 3: Database Design *(Light Summary)*  
Explored schema planning, foreign key creation, and relational database architecture.  
Theoretical focus on:
- Entity relationships
- Data normalization
- Schema visualization  
No required assignment, but served as a crucial prelude to many-to-many design patterns.

### 🔁 Module 4: Many-to-Many Relationships & JSON Export *(Professional Summary)*  
Project-based module using a three-table schema to simulate student-course enrollments.  
Covered:
- Normalized database joins
- Writing complex `SELECT` queries with aliasing
- Exporting query results into JSON
📁 *Folder: `module4-many-to-many`*

🧠 Final Reflection

This course built my confidence in writing raw SQL, navigating different database engines (SQLite vs MySQL), and organizing real-world data into relational schemas. From creating basic tables to exporting structured JSON, I now understand how foundational query logic connects to software applications, dashboards, and API pipelines.

As a simulation technologist transitioning into technical development, these SQL skills ground my understanding of how data flows within interactive XR/VR applications, backend systems, and simulation data logs. I see SQL not as a standalone skill — but as a backbone of structured thinking and logic design.
